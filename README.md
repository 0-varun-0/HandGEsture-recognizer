# Hand Detection System

A real-time hand detection system using OpenCV and MediaPipe to identify and track hand landmarks in a video stream.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use computer vision techniques to detect and visualize hand landmarks in real-time. It utilizes the MediaPipe library for hand tracking and OpenCV for capturing and processing video frames.

## Features

- Real-time hand detection and tracking.
- Visualization of hand landmarks.
- Calculation and display of frames per second (FPS).

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- OpenCV
- MediaPipe

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
